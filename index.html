                Sabrina Carpenter has enchanted an audience of millions as a singer,
                songwriter, actress and style icon. With her music, she has delivered 
                one anthem after another on stage and in the studio, earning multiple 
                gold and platinum certifications, and performing to sold out crowds 
                around the world. On-screen, she has generated mega-fandom through 
                starring roles on television and film. She is signed to Island 
                Records, where she debuted her acclaimed Gold-certified fifth studio 
                album, emails i can’t send, which appeared on many “Best Of 2022” 
                lists including Rolling Stone and Billboard. In April 2024, Sabrina

            <p>
                Academy Award and 14-time GRAMMY-winner Lady Gaga is a one-of-a-kind artist and performer. 
                She has amassed an outstanding 110 million global album sales, 175 billion streams, and 758 
                million song consumption units, making her one of the best-selling musicians of all time. 
                Her most recent pop album, Chromatica, became her sixth consecutive #1 on the Billboard 200 
                chart, making her the first female artist to achieve this over a ten-year period (2011-2020).
                Gaga's collaboration with Ariana Grande on “Rain On Me” had the biggest Spotify debut of 2020, 
                reaching #1 on the Global and US Spotify Charts. In 2023, her debut single “Just Dance” 
                became her third diamond-certified single by the RIAA, joining "Bad Romance" and "Poker Face." 
                In 2018, she won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for “Shallow,” featured on the 
                soundtrack of Best Picture nominee A Star is Born (2018), in addition to claiming a Golden Globe, 
                a Critics’ Choice Award, and four GRAMMYs for both “Shallow” and “I’ll Never Love Again,” also 
                from the same soundtrack. Lady Gaga knows no bounds, from producing her classic pop hits to 
                exploring the classic American Songbook with her albums Cheek to Cheek and Love For Sale with 
                Tony Bennett, both #1 albums. Beyond music, she excels in business as the founder of Haus Labs 
                and thrives as an actress (A Star Is Born, House of Gucci, Joker: Folie à Deux), as well as a 
                passionate activist for mental health and LGBTQ+ rights through her Born This Way Foundation.
