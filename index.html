            <p>
                Sabrina Carpenter has enchanted an audience of millions as a singer,
                songwriter, actress and style icon. With her music, she has delivered 
                one anthem after another on stage and in the studio, earning multiple 
                gold and platinum certifications, and performing to sold out crowds 
                around the world. On-screen, she has generated mega-fandom through 
                starring roles on television and film. She is signed to Island 
                Records, where she debuted her acclaimed Gold-certified fifth studio 
                album, emails i can’t send, which appeared on many “Best Of 2022” 
                lists including Rolling Stone and Billboard. In April 2024, Sabrina 
                debuted at Coachella and released her single “Espresso,” which 
                swiftly climbed to #1 on the UK and Australian charts, reached the 
                Top 5 in the US, and hit #1 globally on Spotify, amassing over 200M 
                streams in its first month. Following this, her second single, 
                “Please Please Please,” released in June, soared to #1 on Spotify’s 
                Global and US charts, Apple Music, and eventually the Billboard Hot 100, 
                where it debuted at #2 before reaching #1. In August, she released her 
                highly anticipated sixth studio album, Short n’ Sweet, which instantly 
                received critical acclaim from the likes of the New York Times, 
                Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and Variety. The album debuted at #1 on the 
                Billboard 200, making it the 3rd biggest first week debut in the US in 2024. 
                Short n' Sweet also topped the charts around the world, reaching #1 in UK, 
                Canada, Australia, Spain, and France.
